# You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

# To work out the love score between two people:

#     Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

#     Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

#     Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.
